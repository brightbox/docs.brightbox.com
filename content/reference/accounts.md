Brightbox services are provided through an Account. A typical customer
has at least one Account through which they manage their resources,
such as Cloud Servers and Load Balancers. It is possible to create
multiple Accounts, for example, to manage resources for separate
customers of your own.

Accounts have a unique identifier of the form `acc-xxxxx`.

Each account has one associated credit card.

### Creating an account

To sign up with Brightbox Cloud,
[create a new account using Brightbox Manager](https://manage.brightbox.com/user/new). This
will create a new account and an associated account owner.

### Account Limits

Each account has a number of default limits that restrict the amount
of resources that can be in use at once.

To view your limits and current usage, use the
[Brightbox Manager](/guides/manager/) and click "Account Limits" in
the side bar.

You can request an increase of any limit by clicking the "Request
increase" button. Set the new limit that you'd like to request and
provide as much information as possible about why you require the
increase.

### Closing your account

To close your account, ensure that all your resources have been
removed (destroy all Servers, Load Balancers and Machine Images and
un-allocate all Cloud IPs etc).

Then, as the owner of the account, use the
[Brightbox Manager](/guides/manager/) to make a
[Billing Support Request](/reference/billing/#support_request) and
request that your account should be closed.

A final invoice will usually be issued within a few days and your
account will be closed.
