[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) is a tool that allows you to create a
complete development environment with a single command - saving loads
of time and getting you productive sooner.

The Brightbox plugin allows you to create that environment on
Brightbox Cloud as easily as you can locally.

The [instructions on how to use the
plugin](https://github.com/NeilW/vagrant-brightbox) are on Github,
along with the code. This is very much a beta release so please report
any issues you find.

If you have any problems, drop us a line at
[support@brightbox.com](mailto:support@brightbox.com) or if you think
you found a bug then
[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/NeilW/vagrant-brightbox/issues).

### Vagrant box files

We build a daily
[list of all the available public server images](/vagrant/images) and
their associated Vagrant box files.
