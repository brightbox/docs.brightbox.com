Once you have [checked the dependencies](/docs/guides/cli/installation) for your
operating system, you are now ready to install the CLI ruby gem package.

#### Installing the Brightbox CLI Gem

Open up a terminal window and enter the command line:

    #!shell
    $ sudo gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc brightbox-cli

If you're using an older version of Ubuntu or Debian, you may instead need to
use the `gem1.9.3` command.

Once the gem is installed, the CLI is ready to use and you can continue with the
[getting started guide](/docs/guides/cli/getting-started/).
