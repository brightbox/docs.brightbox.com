You can use our Ruby gem package to install the CLI on Red Hat-based
Linux distributions such as Fedora, CentOS, or Red Hat itself.

#### Red Hat Dependencies

On Red Hat derivatives use this command to install ruby:

    $ sudo yum install ruby rubygems

You should now be ready to [install the CLI Ruby Gem](/docs/guides/cli/installation-gem/).
