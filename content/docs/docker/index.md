[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications using Linux containerization.

At its core, Docker provides a simple way to describe how your application should be packaged, what its dependencies are and how it should be run.

There are a couple of ways to use Docker on Brightbox Cloud:

* Install Docker on an [Ubuntu Cloud Server](/docs/ubuntu/)
* Build a Cloud Server using [CoreOS](/docs/coreos/)
* Deploy Docker servers using our [Docker Machine Driver](/blog/2015/11/11/docker-machine-driver/)

We also have a guide on [running a private Docker registry on Brightbox Cloud](/docs/guides/docker/private-registry-with-orbit/), using Docker itself.
