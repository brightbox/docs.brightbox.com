## Debugging the CLI

The Command Line Interface tools will output debugging information if you set the DEBUG environment variable to 1. If you come across a bug, try rerunning the command with this set and send the output to us along with the report. Thanks!

    $ DEBUG=1 brightbox-servers explode
