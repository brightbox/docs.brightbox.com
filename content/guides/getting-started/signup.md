The guide will take your through signing up for Brightbox Cloud using
[Brightbox Manager](https://manage.brightbox.com/signup). You'll need
a phone number in the country you're registering the account to, and a
valid credit card.

The first step is to tell us about you. Your name, email address and
your public SSH key. The SSH key is optional at this stage, but most
server images (with the exception of Windows) require one to grant you
access rather than forcing you to faff around setting a password.

### Account info

Then you need to tell us about the account you want to create. If
you're signing up to be a collaborator on someone else's existing
account you can skip this step by clicking the skip link.

### Billing details

Otherwise, provide the required address details, and go onto the
billing details to set a credit card.

### Phone verification

Then onto the phone verification. As a fraud reduction measure, all
accounts have to be verified by phone. Set a phone number and click
"Call me now". You'll receive an automated call which will read out a
four digit number. Type it into the boxes and click "Verify PIN".

When this is complete, you'll be taken to the dashboard where you can
start [building your servers](/guides/manager/getting-started).
