You can use our Ruby gem package to install the CLI on OSX.

#### OSX Dependencies

OSX comes with Ruby gems as standard, but you will also need to have
XCode set up with command line tools.

#### Installing and Configuring XCode

Xcode is available on the
[AppStore](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835) and is free
to download.

When Xcode has finished downloading, open up the App in Launchpad.  You'll be prompted to run the installation for XCode components.  

When this has completed you will need to install the CLI toolset.
In the XCode interface, select the Downloads, then the Components tab.
Install "Command Line Tools".

You should now be ready to [install the CLI Ruby Gem] (/guides/cli/installation-gem/).
