You can use our Ruby gem package to install the CLI on Red Hat-based
Linux distributions such as Fedora, CentOS, or Red Hat itself.

#### Red Hat Dependencies

On Red Hat derivatives use this command to install the latest libraries
and headers:

    $ sudo yum install ruby rubygems ruby-devel make gcc libxslt-devel libxml2-devel

You should now be ready to [install the CLI Ruby Gem] (/guides/cli/installation-gem/).
